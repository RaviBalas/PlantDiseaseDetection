Infected pepper leaves drop prematurely; this exposes fruit to the sun and results in sun scalding. Fruit lesions begin as small, slightly raised blisters, which become dark brown, scab-like, and can appear slightly raised as they increase in size. On leaflets, bacterial spot can be easily confused with the early symptoms of bacterial speck, early blight, gray leaf spot, target spot, or Septoria leaf spot.
